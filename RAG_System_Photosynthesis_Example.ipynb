        "This notebook demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Python. The system combines a retrieval module and a generative model to answer questions based on a small database of documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps:\n",
        "1. **Document Preparation**: We create a small database with example documents.\n",
        "2. **Retrieval Module**: We use FAISS to find the most similar documents to a given query.\n",
        "3. **Generative Model**: We use GPT-2 to generate an answer based on the retrieved documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instructions:\n",
        "1. Run the code cells step by step to see how the RAG system works.\n",
        "2. Modify the example query to test with different questions."
