# GANs for MNIST Digit Generation - handwritten_digit_generation_gan_mnist.ipynb

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. GANs are a powerful class of neural networks used in unsupervised machine learning tasks.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two main components:
- **Generator**: Generates fake images from random noise and class labels.
- **Discriminator**: Discriminates between real and fake images.

The networks are trained simultaneously in a process where the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by producing increasingly realistic images, while the Discriminator strives to become better at distinguishing real images from fakes.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
The Generator takes a noise vector and a label as input and produces an image corresponding to the label. It uses a series of linear and convolutional layers to generate the image.

### Discriminator
The Discriminator takes an image and its label as input and outputs the probability that the image is real. It uses a series of linear layers to perform this classification.

## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:
1. **Train the Discriminator**: Using both real images and fake images generated by the Generator, compute the loss and update the Discriminator.
2. **Train the Generator**: Generate fake images and compute the loss based on the Discriminator's output. Update the Generator to improve its performance.

The training alternates between these two steps, allowing both networks to improve together.

## Results

The final output of the training process is a set of generated images for each digit from 0 to 9. These images are expected to resemble handwritten digits closely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
    ```

2. Run the notebook or script to start training the GAN:
    ```bash
    python handwritten_digit_generation_gan_mnist.ipynb
    ```

3. View the generated images after training completes.
