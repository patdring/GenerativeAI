# GANs for MNIST Digit Generation - handwritten_digit_generation_gan_mnist.ipynb

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. GANs are a powerful class of neural networks used in unsupervised machine learning tasks.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two main components:
- **Generator**: Generates fake images from random noise and class labels.
- **Discriminator**: Discriminates between real and fake images.

The networks are trained simultaneously in a process where the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by producing increasingly realistic images, while the Discriminator strives to become better at distinguishing real images from fakes.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
The Generator takes a noise vector and a label as input and produces an image corresponding to the label. It uses a series of linear and convolutional layers to generate the image.

### Discriminator
The Discriminator takes an image and its label as input and outputs the probability that the image is real. It uses a series of linear layers to perform this classification.

## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:
1. **Train the Discriminator**: Using both real images and fake images generated by the Generator, compute the loss and update the Discriminator.
2. **Train the Generator**: Generate fake images and compute the loss based on the Discriminator's output. Update the Generator to improve its performance.

The training alternates between these two steps, allowing both networks to improve together.

## Results

The final output of the training process is a set of generated images for each digit from 0 to 9. These images are expected to resemble handwritten digits closely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
    ```

2. Run the notebook or script to start training the GAN:
    ```bash
    python handwritten_digit_generation_gan_mnist.ipynb
    ```

3. View the generated images after training completes.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Example - RAG_System_Photosynthesis_Example.ipynb

This notebook contains a simple example of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The system combines a retrieval module with a generative model to answer questions based on a small database of documents.

## Overview

RAG systems are designed to improve the quality of generated answers by leveraging relevant information retrieved from a large corpus of documents. This example demonstrates the basic principles of a RAG system using the following steps:

1. **Document Preparation**: We create a small database with example documents about photosynthesis.
2. **Retrieval Module**: We use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to find the most similar documents to a given query.
3. **Generative Model**: We use GPT-2, a generative language model, to generate an answer based on the retrieved documents.

## Installation

To run this example, you need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers faiss-cpu
```

# Text-to-Speech with Emotion Modulation - text_to_Speech_with_Emotion_Modulation.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how to generate speech from text using different libraries and techniques, including gTTS, pyttsx3, and pydub, and how to modulate the generated speech to reflect different emotions, genders, and ages.

## Steps:
1. **Install Required Packages**: Install gTTS, pyttsx3, and pydub for text-to-speech conversion and audio processing.
2. **Generate Speech with gTTS**: Convert text to speech using Google Text-to-Speech.
3. **Modulate Speech with pydub**: Apply filters and speed changes to simulate different emotions, genders, and ages.

### Instructions:
1. Run the installation cell to install the required packages.
2. Execute the text-to-speech generation cell to create speech files with different emotional modulations.
3. Modify the example texts and parameters to test with different inputs.
